If you want to run xlocate as a daemon to speed things up, but avoid using a
web-browser, you can emulate ordinary locate's behavior this way.
Start xlocate with -template "{{.Path}}/{{.Base}}" option, and use the following
shell script to look up files

xlocate.sh
  #!/bin/bash
  # Assuming that the deamon is running at the default port.
  PORT=9188
  wget --quiet -O - "http://localhost:${PORT}/$@"
